Azure Application Security Groups (ASGs) with Virtual Networks
Project Overview
This project extends my foundational Virtual Network implementation by introducing Application Security Groups (ASGs) to create a role-based network security architecture. 
This demonstrates advanced Azure networking concepts and enterprise-grade security practices.

Architecture Evolution
From IP-Based to Role-Based Security
* Previous Approach: Security rules based on IP addresses and subnets
* Current Approach: Security rules based on application roles and functions
* Business Value: Scalable, maintainable and self-documenting security policies

Infrastructure Components
Virtual Network Foundation
* Virtual Network: MyVNet (10.0.0.0/16)
* WebTier Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
* DatabaseTier Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24

Enhanced Network Security Groups
* WebTier-NSG: Updated with ASG-based rules
* DatabaseTier-NSG: Configured for role-based access control

Skills Demonstrated
Intermediate Azure Networking
* Application Security Groups: Role-based network security
* VM Deployment & Management: Multi-tier infrastructure
* Advanced NSG Configuration: ASG-integrated security rules
* Network Segmentation: Application-aware traffic control
* Security Policy Management: Scalable rule administration

Enterprise Networking Concepts
* Micro-segmentation: Isolation of application componentsDefense in Depth: Multiple layers of security controls
* Identity-based Security: Resources grouped by function, not location
* Policy as Code: Reusable, maintainable security configurations

Technical Learning Outcomes
Advanced Concepts Mastered
* ASG vs NSG: Understanding when and how to use each approach
* Rule Precedence: Managing security rule priorities and conflicts
* Network Interface Management: Associating VMs with security groups
* Cross-Subnet Communication: Controlling traffic between network tiers
* Security Rule Optimization: Reducing complexity while maintaining security

Real-World Applications
* Enterprise Network Design: Multi-tier application security
* Cloud Migration: Translating on-premises security to cloud-native
* Compliance Requirements: Implementing security controls for regulated industries
* DevOps Integration: Security policies that scale with infrastructure

Benefits Achieved
* Clarity: Rules are self-documenting and business-readable
* Scalability: Adding new web servers automatically applies correct policies
* Maintainability: Changes to server roles don't require IP address updates
* Compliance: Audit-friendly security configurations
